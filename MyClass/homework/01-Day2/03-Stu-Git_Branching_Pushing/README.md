# Student Do: Git Branching and Pushing

## Introduction

In this activity, we will create a new branch, implement a feature, and then submit a pull request back into the main branch. We will also cover reviewing pull requests and merging them into the main branch.

## Instructions

### Part I: Branching and Submitting a Pull Request

In this section, we will create a branch, add a feature, and submit a pull request.

1. Clone the project repo onto your computer and use the `cd` (change directory) command to get into it.

2. Run the following command in your terminal to create and checkout to a new branch:

  `git checkout -b new-branch`

3. You should now be on a new branch named "new-branch." In order to verify that this worked, run the following command in your terminal:

  `git branch`

4. You should see two branches listed: `main` and `new-branch`. The `new-branch` branch should have an asterisk to the left of it. This indicates that this is the branch you're currently on.

5. At the root of the repo, create a new file named `README.md`. Inside this file, add some general text about creating a branch, and save.

6. In your terminal, add and commit the changes. Then push up your file by running the following in your terminal:

  `git push origin new-branch`

7. This should push up your file to GitHub on a branch with the same name (`new-branch`).

8. Go to the main repo page at github.com and you should see a button that says "Compare & pull request." Click this.

9. On the next screen, add a description of the work that was done in the text area and click the "Pull Request" button.

10. If completed successfully, you should see the pull request listed under the repo's "Pull request" tab.

### Part II: Reviewing a Pull Request

In this section, we will review the pull request from Part I and merge it into the main.

1. Clone the repo to your computer if you haven't already done so, and use the `cd` command to get into it.

2. First, you will want to test the changes introduced by the `new-branch` branch locally. To examine the new branch on your local machine, run the following commands in your terminal:

  `git fetch --all`

  `git checkout new-branch`

3. This code should bring the copy of the `new-branch` branch that is on GitHub onto your computer.

  * Make sure this worked by verifying that there's a `README.md` file in your local repo.

  * Typically, you would run the code here to make sure everything works properly.

4. Check back out to your local `main` branch by running the following in your terminal:

  `git checkout main`

5. Now go to your GitHub repo's main page and go to the "Pull request" section. Select the `new-branch` pull request from the list.

6. On the next page, select the option to see the "Files changed."

	![Select the files that have changed.](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m1/lesson_2/img/changed-files.png)

7. You should be presented with all of the files that were changed in this PR, along with line numbers for any code added or removed.

8. If there are any changes you would like made, you can click the line number to leave a comment the PR author will see and should address before approval. Otherwise click "Review changes" and approve the PR. You should be taken to a screen with an option to "Merge pull request." Click this button.

9. Once complete, you can delete the feature branch from your machine by running the following in your terminal:

  `git branch -D new-branch`

Ask an instructor or TA if you get stuck or have any questions!
