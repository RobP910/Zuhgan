# Student Do: Protect the Main Branch

## Introduction

In this activity, we will protect our repo's main branch.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the repo's "Settings" page on GitHub and then select "Branches" from the left sidebar.

2. From the "Branches" page, click the `Add branch protection rule` button in the "Branch protection rules" section. You should be presented with some options:

  * First, type a rule name in the "Branch name pattern" box.

  * Then, check off the following:

    * "Require pull request reviews before merging"

    * "Include administrators"

3. Click the green `Create` button to finalize the changes.

4. If completed successfully, no one should be able to push directly to the main branch. Instead, all changes must be made in the form of pull requests that are to be reviewed by another group member.

> **Remember** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
